# Handoff

## State (2026-10-09)
Phases 0–3 first pass done with fixture content; Phase 4 (Sheets) is Juanpi's.
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (10 selector tests) and `pnpm build` pass, also with `BASE_PATH=/testsite/caravelas` (assets, hreflang, noindex meta + header verified in the build output).
- Hero: poster → lazy WebGL2 zigzag refraction on `public/video/hero.{webm,mp4}` (≈2 MB each, 960×540, 24 fps), with green tint overlays. Falls back to the poster on no WebGL2 / reduced motion / saveData / context lost. Pauses off-screen and on hidden tab. Shader params are in `src/components/Hero/refraction.ts` (tuned by eye against Figma `1:10`, not pixel-matched).
- Marquee, feature rotator (4 real features from Figma), schedule (table + day tabs, "today" in Europe/Lisbon), price band with squiggle, Capitães, footer, mobile menu, PT `/` + EN `/en`, JSON-LD, OG image, `/status`, `/api/revalidate`.
- Assets from Figma in `public/assets/` (logo, feature icons, team photo, map, CrossFit logos, squiggles). Raw downloads and reference screenshots are in `source/` (git-ignored).
- Fixture content mirrors the Figma desktop frame. Placeholders: RegyBox CTA link, Instagram/Facebook URLs of the gym, footer opening hours, JSON-LD geo. Confirmed: WhatsApp +351 912 849 143; emails feu.ferreira@ and ana.lima@caravelas.fit.

## Update — fidelity pass + languages (2026-10-09)
- Layout re-done from Figma `get_design_context` per section (colors and sizes are the Figma values; text sizes follow Figma, e.g. cell names 12px, coach line 8px, bios 12px — deliberate, the user asked to follow Figma over the legibility deviations in SPEC §12.1). Geometry measured at 1728px matches Figma: header 147, hero 667, column 1000, table 143/32/43, price items at 303/485/683/881, team 502 with the 931px photo at x=864, map 374×301.
- Languages: PT (`/`), EN, ES, FR, DE, RU, UK (`/en`, `/es`, `/fr`, `/de`, `/ru`, `/uk` via `src/app/(intl)/[lang]`). Language menu is a dropdown with inline SVG flags (replaces the `PT · EN` toggle, SPEC D5). UI strings in `src/i18n/*.ts` (machine-written translations: ask native speakers to review). Cyrillic uses Source Sans 3 as a per-glyph fallback (Lato has none).
- Hero title is never translated. Map: real Google Maps iframe (lazy), loaded as soon as the visitor accepts the cookie notice (the only third-party cookies on the site; choice in localStorage, reopenable from the footer; until then a placeholder with an "open in Google Maps" link). **Before launch:** write the real Cookie/Privacy policy pages the footer links to.
- Inter Bold is used for the schedule section title (as in Figma).

- Legal: **ported** (owner decision: use the old site's texts, literally). `/politica-de-privacidade` and `/politica-de-cookies` (Portuguese, grey page like the team section) with the verbatim text of the old Wix pages, kept in `src/content/legal/`; footer + cookie bar link to them (`config.privacyHref/cookiesHref` only override). This resolves SPEC §3.5 step 4 for the policies; the old Wix URLs can be redirected to these when the Wix site closes. Known limits of the old text: it does not mention Google Maps, has no date, PT only. `docs/COOKIES_ADDENDUM.md` (Maps paragraph) is parked, not used.

## Deploy (2026-10-09)
- Repo: https://github.com/nic0lino/caravelas-site (public). Vercel project `caravelas-site` (scope `nicods9302-4882s-projects`), GitHub-connected: every push to `main` deploys to production. Env vars are set in Vercel (Production only), incl. a random `REVALIDATE_SECRET`.
- Live: https://caravelas-site.vercel.app/testsite/caravelas and https://nicolino.zip/testsite/caravelas (rewrite in the portfolio's `vercel.json` + `testsite` excluded from its `proxy.ts` matcher; the portfolio is deployed with `vercel deploy --prod`, it has no git remote).
- Behind that rewrite Next's segment prefetches 404, so header/language `Link`s use `prefetch={false}`.
- Hobby plan: Juanpi can't be added to the Vercel project; to work on it he needs the `cravel` team (Pro) or his own Vercel + GitHub collaborator access.

- Team photo tags (`src/components/Team/PhotoTags.tsx`): Instagram tags for each coach + the gym (`config.instagram`, pointing at the rack bars). The triangle aims at the tagged spot; if a tag would be cut by the edge of the visible photo or hit another tag it swings to the other side of its spot (never off the margins). Touch: all appear ~1.2s after the photo is seen. Pointer (desktop): hovering a person's face/chest shows only their tag (zones in `zoneAt`: her half, his half, rack bars = gym); the tag follows the cursor, its triangle points at the cursor, it swings to the other side near the edges, and clicking the person opens their Instagram. Keyboard focus on a tag also shows it. Handles are shown without the @. Spot coordinates are fractions of the cut-out (`public/assets/team-people.webp`) — re-tune `SPOTS` if it changes. Real handles in the fixture: @feu_ferreira, @_ana.lima_; gym handle (@crossfitcaravelas) still to confirm.

- Team section follows the Figma frame **"Os capitaes"** (`24:7062`, page `page`), which supersedes SPEC §6.5: gym photo (`team-bg.jpg`, 1200×800 offset -149) faded into the card (#ededed gradient 32%→100% + 65% veil) behind the cut-out coaches (`team-people.webp`, 628×586, standing on the card floor, card 586 high). Mobile (< lg) uses the same recipe in a 255-high window with Ana first, then Feu (Frame 56 `24:7090`). Desktop composition from `lg` (1024+).

- Type scale (2026-10-09): only 12/14/16/20/32 + fluid `display` (+ `2xs` 10px for the cookie bar), defined in `globals.css`. Table: class names 14px, coach line 12px, times 20px, rows 48. Marquee 20px (14 mobile). Hero stacks below `lg`. Cookie notice is a slim bottom bar. Mobile team: the cut-out rises 40px over the section above (schedule section's bottom padding is 12px). Schedule table + pricing band are one card (table rounds only the top).

- Floating CTA (`src/components/Hero/CtaButton.tsx`): a copy of the trial-class button fixed to the screen appears (fade + 14px slide, 260ms) once the hero's own has scrolled out above the viewport, and leaves when it is back. Same X as the original (same column/gutters/alignment per breakpoint), Y fixed 72px from the bottom (above the cookie bar when it is open). Rendered in `<body>` via a portal. The button's hard shadow is its own layer with `mix-blend-multiply` (a drop-shadow can't blend; the floating copy needs a second fixed layer because `fixed` is its own stacking context). Button hover turns the label white.

## Next steps
- Compare against Figma at 1728 / 440 widths (only checked by eye at 1200, 599 and 375); Playwright smoke test; Lighthouse on the deployed URL (not run).
- Hero: separate portrait video crop for mobile if needed; the source video is a split-screen of two clips, so check the crop on phones. Poster is a plain frame, not a pre-rendered shader frame.
- Marquee: verify no jump after font load / resize on a real device; reduced-motion CSS is untested.
- Privacy / Cookies pages (footer links are `#`) and Livro de Reclamações logo (text link for now).
- Deploy: Vercel project + rewrite in nicolino.zip (Nico, separate PR).

## Hero credential badges
- `src/components/Hero/Badges.tsx`: CrossFit Affiliates (→ `config.affiliateHref`), Google rating (→ maps.app.goo.gl link), Wodily Top 1 Lisboa (→ wodily.com/city/pt/lisbon). SVGs in `public/assets/badge-*.svg` (Wodily's embedded PNG downsampled to 700px).
- The Google rating (4.9, "more than 100 reviews") is baked into the SVG artwork: re-export it when the number changes.
- The Wodily and Google URLs are constants in `Badges.tsx`, not in the contract (see Requests).

## Open questions
- Real RegyBox link, WhatsApp, email, social URLs, opening hours; 3×/sem price (desktop €70 vs mobile).
- Museo Sans licence (D4). The 4th feature reuses the ship icon.
- Coach copy/bios are taken from the Figma frame; confirm they are final.

## Requests
- Juanpi: implement `src/content/sources/sheets.ts` (+ parsers, harden `/api/revalidate`); set `CONTENT_SOURCE=sheets`.
- Contract (Nico/Juanpi, `contract:` PR): optionally add `wodilyHref` and `googleReviewsHref` to `SiteConfig` so the badge links can be edited from the sheet.
